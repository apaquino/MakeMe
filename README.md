# MakeMe

Q: What do you get when you combine a drill sergeant, great music, and a tough workout you can do from anywhere?

A: This prototype iPhone app.

Use the app to find workouts you like, save them, and perform them at your convenience. Each workout has a skill level, equipment needed, space required, and a time duration in minutes. Each workout also has a trainer associated with it and audio/music.

When performing the workout via the GO button, users will hear the trainer's voice guiding them through the workout and offering helpful advice on proper form and technique.

Users also have a profile which lists their activity on the app, their progress, and their favorite routines and trainers.

This project is a collaboration between [Valentina Pherson](https://github.com/VisValentina) and [Armand Aquino](https://github.com/apaquino).
For this current version, Valentina was in charge of styling, art direction, and asset building. Armand lead the implementation of developing the application using React-Native, Flux, and a custom Objective-C library.

Issues:
* Currently designed only for iPhone 6.
* New users will not get their first workout added to their playlist immediately.
* Only one audio track - future version will feature an audio track unique to each workout.

This is still an early work in progress and more features and instructions to install will be added later.

NOTE:  The app is only using seed data for trainer database, user database, and routine database.  This is for ease of use with installation.  

## Installation
There is no additional database to setup or cloud database you have to sign up for and configure both on the database and the app.

```
npm install
```

Please follow the Facebook instructions to open the application on xCode and perform a build.
