# MakeMe

This is a proof of concept app for creating exercise routines and virtual trainers.

It is a collaboration between [Valentina Pherson](https://github.com/VisValentina) and [Armand Aquino](https://github.com/apaquino)

Some technologies used are React-Native, Flux, React-Native-Router-Flux.

Designed only for iPhone 6 for now.

Still an early work in progress and more features and instructions to install will be added later.

TODO

Style in all components
Try not to use pixels to place, let it flow, but sometimes it is necessary, if necessary, then state why
Routines show in profile, see changes i made trainershow
question: routines have a trainer id, trainer pic etc, but trainers can have routines that they don't "own"?
